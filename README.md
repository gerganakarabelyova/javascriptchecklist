# JavaScript Checklist website project

This is a Bootstrap-powered simple website project with a purely JavaScript check list for ToDo tasks. You can add tasks, cross them off when they are done, and create a new list afterwards. I created the project with exercising purposes - to see how I can implement my newly acquired JavaScript skills. This was in December 2017, while I was looking for a job as a Front-End Software Developer.

# Characteristics of the website:
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript ˚˖𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒✧˚.🎀༘⋆
- Simple, clean design ˚˖𓍢ִִ໋🌊🦈˚˖𓍢ִ✧˚.
- Added tasks appear as checkboxes
- Checkboxes can be crossed off when the task is done
- Option to clear the list and start from 0 with a new list
